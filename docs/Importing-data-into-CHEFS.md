***

There is no bulk upload feature in CHEFS. If you want to add submissions into CHEFS that you collected through other means, you can use the API. 

To import data, create an external script that reads through your data and submits it to CHEFS through the API as a new submission. You would then authenticate the request using the API key generated in the CHEFS form settings.

* [To get started, review the "createSubmission" endpoint](https://submit.digital.gov.bc.ca/app/api/v1/docs#operation/createSubmission)
