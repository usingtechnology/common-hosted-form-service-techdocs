***


In the event that someone has deleted a submission for a form version, you can restore the submission if you are a form owner.

For example, if a user deletes a form submission:
<img width="731" alt="img" src="images/restore1.png">

The form owner can access the submissions for a form, and check the box to show deleted submissions.

Once you've found the submission you want to restore, simply click the restore button and confirm restoration.
