## CHEFS forms in action

CHEFS has a lot of different features to help you collect data. Below are some examples of what others in the CHEFS community are doing with their forms.

Is your form taking advantage of CHEFS more advanced features? Or are you using it to collect a lot of different data? If you are interested in sharing your form with the broader community, send us an export of your form and the URL so others can check it out. You can send your files to [submit.digital@gov.bc.ca](mailto:submit.digital@gov.bc.ca).

## Examples of CHEFS features

We have created some examples of features you might want to use in your forms. Feel free to download the JSON files and incorporate them into your forms.
 
**Note:** **You will want to import the JSON into a new form, as it will overwrite any of your existing work.**
