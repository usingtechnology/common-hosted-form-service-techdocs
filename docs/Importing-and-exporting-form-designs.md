## Import a form design
**[Back to top](#top)**

To import an example form, or one of your own exported forms:

1. Hit the 'Import' button
2. Find the JSON file on your computer
3. Hit 'Open'

The imported form will load into the designer. **Be careful**, the imported form will **replace** anything you've started so you may want to import into a newly created form.

## Export a form design
**[Back to top](#top)**

To export a form:

1. Hit the 'Export' button
2. Save the JSON file to your computer

Exporting forms is a great way to copy an existing design or share it with others.
